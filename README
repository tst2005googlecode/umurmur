README for uMurmur - minimalistic Mumble server
===============================================
http://code.google.com/p/umurmur/

Contains protobuf-c library code which is Copyright 2008, Dave Benson.
See http://code.google.com/p/protobuf-c/

1. Requirements
o OpenSSL or PolarSSL library
o libConfig

2. Build
cd to src directory
Might need to edit Makefile
make

3. Install
o Copy umurmurd from src directory to where you want it,
  /usr/local/sbin/ for example.
o Edit umurmur.conf.example to your liking and put it in a suitable place.
  /etc/umurmur.conf is default.

Some day I might put together an autoconf with the typical configure &&
make && make install, but we'll see.

4. Run
As daemon:

umurmurd -c <conf file> -p <PID file> -r

For other switches and their meaning run:

umurmurd -h

A startup script can easily be created if you want to. Just copy an
existing script and edit it to your liking.

5. Support/Contact/Documentation
See the project page, link above.

Have fun!
