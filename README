README for uMurmur - minimalistic Mumble server
===============================================
http://code.google.com/p/umurmur/

See http://code.google.com/p/protobuf-c/

uMurmur is available as a precompiled package for some distributions. Check
your package repository if you are running OpenWRT or Freetz.

There are makefiles in the openwrt subdirectory suitable for buildning with
the OpenWRT SDK. Move the Makefile of choice to the base directory, e.g.:

# mv openwrt/Makefile.polarssl Makefile

and then put the whole umurmur-X.X.X directory in the SDK's 'packages'
directory.


Instructions for building from source:
1. Requirements
o OpenSSL or PolarSSL library
o libConfig

2. Build
cd to src directory
Might need to edit Makefile
make

3. Install
o Copy umurmurd from src directory to where you want it,
  /usr/local/sbin/ for example.
o Edit umurmur.conf.example to your liking and put it in a suitable place.
  /etc/umurmur.conf is default.

Some day I might put together an autoconf with the typical configure &&
make && make install, but we'll see.

4. Run
As daemon:

umurmurd -c <conf file> -p <PID file> -r

For other switches and their meaning run:

umurmurd -h

A startup script can easily be created if you want to. Just copy an
existing script and edit it to your liking.

Have fun!
